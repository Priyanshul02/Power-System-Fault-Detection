# Power-System-Fault-Detection
Design an ML model using voltage and current phasors to classify power distribution faults. Extract features like phase angles, magnitudes, and harmonics. Use a supervised algorithm (e.g., Random Forest or CNN) to detect and classify faults (L-G, L-L, 3-phase) versus normal states, enabling fast, accurate fault response.     Ask ChatGPT
